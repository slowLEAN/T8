in this task we have  performed customer segmentation on the Mall Customers dataset using the K-Means clustering algorithm. It starts by loading and previewing the data, followed by visualizing the distributions of key features such as age, annual income, and spending score to understand the overall customer landscape. The gender column is encoded numerically, and all relevant features are standardized to ensure fair clustering. The code then applies the Elbow Method and calculates silhouette scores to determine the optimal number of clusters, which is found to be five. K-Means clustering is applied with this optimal value, and the resulting customer groups are visualized in a scatter plot, with centroids clearly marked. The code also profiles each cluster by calculating the average age, income, and spending score, and presents the distribution of customers across clusters using a pie chart. Finally, it prints the silhouette score for the final clustering, providing a quantitative measure of how well the customers have been grouped. This workflow enables effective identification of distinct customer segments for targeted business strategies.
